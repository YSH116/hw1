(1) how to setup and run your program？ 
First, import module and read data from 108061226.csv. Second, use functions of python to delete the unused files whose value of the WDSD (wind speed) column is '-99.000' or '-999.000', and compare the remainder to find the maximum range by letting the first data be the basis. We should be careful that if the number of data lowers than 2, then there will not exist maximum range. Finally, output the results with the format of array. 

(2) what are the results？
[['C0A880', 1.7], ['C0F9A0', 2.2], ['C0G640', 3.3], ['C0R190', 2.5], ['C0X260', 4.0]] are selected from 108061226.csv.
